### What I learned

It is the first time that I make a hamburger menu navigation. I think that it is a clever solution for small screens and I had fun developing it. However, I think I took more time than what I should, so I plan on developing more projects that have hamburger menu nav so that I can practice it and feel comfortable doing it, because it is a component that is often found on modern websites.
